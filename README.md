 Hi, Iâ€™m Chris P
-Iâ€™m interested in building my knowledge of programming 
     as I am new to the field.
- Iâ€™m currently learning Python
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with fellow Python beginners as well
  as experienced developers.  I have a background in ERP
  Implementation, software testing and technical team leadership. I have recently
  began exploring more hands on development skills and
  have really enjoyed the creative nature of the work.
